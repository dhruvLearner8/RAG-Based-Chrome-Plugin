Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a US$1 trillion company, the sixth US company to reach that valuation. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[5] In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024[6] and February 2025,[7] and since May 2025.[8] In November 2025, Tesla approved a pay package worth $1 trillion for Musk, which he is to receive over 10 years if he meets specific goals.[9] In January 2026, the company would lose its status as world's lead manufacturer of electric vehicles.[10] Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack",

History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Founding (2003\u20132004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc., on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[11][12] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[13] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[14] Ian Wright joined Eberhard and Tarpenning a few months later.[11] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12.5 million in 2024) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10.8 million in 2024) from Elon Musk, who had received $176 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier.[15] Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[16][17][13] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[18] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five \u2013 Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel \u2013 to call themselves co-founders.[19] Roadster (2005\u20132009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the",

Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[25] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and president.[26] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[26] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[27] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[28]",

Musk had contributed $70 million of his money to the company.[31] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[32] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[33][34] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010\u20132015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million.[35] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO), the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[36] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share at its opening on the NASDAQ, raising $226 million.[37] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model",

In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[44] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[45] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[46] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[47][48] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016\u20132018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[49] The",

The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[53] To speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[54] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell\".[55][56] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[57][58] This period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market.

Global expansion and Model Y (2019\u2013present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[61] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[62] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[63] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[64] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[65] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[65][66] It became the sixth US company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in October 2021.[67] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[68][69] Deliveries started in March 2020.[70] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[78] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[79] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[80] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[81][82] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California.

Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting bitcoin.[89] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[90] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[91] In November, Tesla started shipping the Cybertruck, produced from Gigafactory Texas.[92] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[93] In",

The decision arose from a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders who claimed the compensation was excessive and not aligned with performance metrics.[98] By February 2025, Tesla saw large decreases in its stock price and sales across Europe widely attributed to Musk's political advocacy and embrace of far-right politics.[99] Polling found that Musk's ties to United States President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency were strongly correlated to decreasing views of Tesla,[100][101] and triggered multiple protests, vandalism, gunfire, and arson at Tesla stores and charging stations.[102][103] By March 7, Tesla's stock had decreased every week for seven straight weeks since Musk joined the Trump administration, making it the longest losing streak for Tesla in 15 years as a public company.[104] On March 29, over 200 protests against Tesla were held worldwide.[105] In July 2025, Tesla released",

Unlike vehicles equipped with Grok, AI in Tesla's Chinese vehicles may be used to control vehicle functions, as well as act as a chatbot.[109][110] In December 2025, Tesla's UK registrations fell by more than 29% year-on-year. UK sales also fell by 8.9% year-on-year.[111] In January 2026, the title of world's largest battery electric vehicle manufacturer was lost to Chinese competitor BYD after full year 2025 deliveries were reported by both companies (2,256,714 vs 1,636,129 BEV sales).[112] On January 28, 2026, Musk stated that Tesla would discontinue the Model S and Model X in the second quarter of 2026 to focus on manufacturing the Optimus robot.[113] Automotive products As of November 2024, Tesla offers six vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Semi, and Cybertruck.

This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[21][163] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[164][165] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, unlike nearly every other car manufacturer.[166] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company sells vehicles directly through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[167][168] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers since the widespread adoption of the franchised dealer model.[169][170] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers.

Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multipart aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris or vehicle crashes.[189] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[190] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells.

Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[191] However, the decision turned out to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[186] 2170 The next battery type to be used was the 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[186] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[192] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[193] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.

Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly predicted that the company would achieve fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) within one to three years, but these goals are still to be met. The branding of Full Self-Driving has drawn criticism for potentially misleading consumers. Tesla vehicles currently operate at Level 2 automation, which requires continuous driver supervision and does not constitute \"full\" self-driving capability. Previously, the Autopilot branding was also criticized for similar reasons, despite the fact that no autopilot system in aircraft rendered them fully autonomous. Tesla claims that its driver-assistance features improve safety and reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue or inattention.

Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[220] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly, and between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[221] Grohmann Automation,[222] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[223] Musk later said that the robotics slowed production of the vehicles.[54] Subsequently, Tesla shifted towards using massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots.[224][225] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[226] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[227] On January 28, 2026, Tesla announced it would stop manufacturing the Model S and Model X to focus efforts on Optimus.

The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[249] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[35] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[232] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[250] Model 3 drivetrains,[251] and the Tesla Semi.[252] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax-free for 10 years,[253] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[252] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant.

Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their dealers.[174] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[382][383][384] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[385] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[171] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[174] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[140] Intellectual property Tesla has sued former employees for stealing company information, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox.[386] For example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla",

Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligently\".

This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[435] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[424][436] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to",

The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[514] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[515] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[516] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[517] In 2025, the California DMV filed a lawsuit against Tesla, claiming it had misled drivers about its vehicles' self-driving capabilities. The DMV sought to suspend Tesla's sales and manufacturing in the state of California for a minimum of 30 days.[518][519] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the",

They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[523] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[524] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[525] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[526][527] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3",

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (August 2025) In February 2022, Tesla drivers reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot, which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[530] In response, NHTSA opened an investigation the same month.[531] In August 2022, a consumer class action was filed alleging that the Autopilot system in Tesla cars \"contains a hazardous defect which causes the vehicle to suddenly and unintentionally brake\".[532][533] In November 2024, Tesla failed to persuade a US District Judge to dismiss the lawsuit.[534] The next court date is January 7, 2025.[534] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[535] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[536] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were",

When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem, and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[540] Vehicle sales In 2024, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 17.6%.[541] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[542][543] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[544] In Q4 2023, Tesla's competitor BYD, a chinese EV company, took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[545] On January 2, 2026, BYD became the",

The federal government previously provided a $7500 rebate to customers.[547][548][549] Tesla received around $426 million from the Chinese government for cars manufactured at its Shanghai facility.[550] Germany was Tesla's third-largest market in 2023, selling 63,682 units. Germany ended its EV subsidy program in December 2023. Under the program, a \u20ac6,750 discount was provided with Tesla paying \u20ac2,250. Tesla announced it would cover the entire discount going forward.[551] In 2023, over 63,000 Teslas were sold in France with customers receiving up to \u20ac7,000 via the bonus \u00e9cologique. The government decreased the budget for EV aid from \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac700 million in 2024.[552] Canada was in Tesla's top five markets in 2023 with over 52,000 vehicles sold. In 2025, Tesla was accused of having \"a run on the bank\" when it sold a historic 8,600 vehicles in 72 hours before Canada's EV rebate program's funds were depleted.

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps.

    "chunk": "is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is primarily played in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Australia, New Zealand, England and Wales, South Africa and the West Indies.[2] While cricket has traditionally been played largely by men, women's cricket has experienced significant growth in the 21st century.[3] The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country, and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.[4][5] History Main article: History of cricket Origins Main article: History of cricket to 1725 A medieval \"club ball\" game involving an underarm bowl towards a batter.

Others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category[6]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[7] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a \"wicket gate\" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[8] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three \"groups\" of \"club ball\" games: the \"hockey group\", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the \"golf group\", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the \"cricket group\", in which \"the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it\".[9] It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.[8] Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land, and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:[10][11][12] Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies. Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school, and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey.[12] The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\", and the verb form \"crosser\" as \"to play at cricket\".[13][14] One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word \"cryce\" (or \"cricc\") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\".[10] In Old French, the word \"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[15] Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) \"krick\"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).[15] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church that resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[16] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, \"met de (krik ket)sen\" (\"with the stick chase\").[17] Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[17] Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England Evolution of the cricket bat.

The original \"hockey stick\" (left) evolved into the straight bat from c. 1760, when pitched delivery bowling began. Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.[18] The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[19][20][21] In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[22] This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played, at Chevening, Kent.[10][23] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[24] Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.[14] It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth.[25][26] The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play, as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.[27][28] According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after the Restoration\" in 1660.[29] Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era.[30] Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to \u00a3100, which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.[29] Along with horse racing, as well as prizefighting and other types of blood sport, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.[31] Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.[32] By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers\u2014the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.[33] A 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\", the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.[34][35] The patrons and other players from the gentry began to classify themselves as \"amateurs\"[fn 1] to",

Society insisted that such people were \"officers and gentlemen\" whose destiny was to provide leadership.[38] In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure, and the derisive term \"shamateur\" was coined to describe the practice.[39][40] English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries Francis Cotes, The Young Cricketer, 1768 The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport.[41] Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.[42] Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.[citation needed] The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season.[43] Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch (bounce) the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape.[44][citation needed] The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.[citation needed] MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century include the three-stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).[45] The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial.[46] Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839.[47] In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.[48] The first recorded photo of a cricket match taken on 25 July 1857 by",

G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, de facto professional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.[citation needed] The last two decades before the First World War have been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.[49] Cricket becomes an international sport The first English team to tour overseas, on board ship to North America, 1859 Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas, and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which also includes present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North America and South Africa.[50] In 1844, the first international match took place between what were essentially club teams,[51] from the United States and Canada, in New York; Canada won.[52][53] In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour.[54] In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.[55] The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.[56] In 1876\u201377, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.[57] The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, which remains Test cricket's most famous contest.[58] Test cricket began to expand in 1888\u201389 when South Africa played England.[59] Cricket in the 20th century Don Bradman of Australia had a record Test batting average of 99.94. The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batter of all time. To curb his dominance, England employed bodyline tactics during the 1932\u201333 Ashes series. These involved bowling at the body of the batter and setting a field, resulting in batters having to choose between being hit or risk getting out. This series moved cricket from a game to a matter of national importance, with diplomatic cables being passed between the two countries over the incident.[60] During this time, the number of Test nations continued to grow, with the West Indies, New Zealand and India being admitted as full Test members within a four-year period from 1928 to 1932.

An enforced break during the Second World War stopped Test Cricket for a time, although the Partition of India caused Pakistan to gain Test status in 1952. As teams began to travel more, the game quickly grew from 500 tests in 84 years to 1000 within the next 23. Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant.[61] As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative, and the number of matches increased.[62] The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971, and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975.[63] Sri Lanka joined the ranks in 1982. Meanwhile, South Africa was banned by the ICC due to apartheid from 1970 until 1992. 1992 also brought about the introduction of the Zimbabwe team.[64] Cricket in the 21st century The Indian Premier League (IPL) was launched in 2008. It has become one of the richest sports leagues in the world, and has greatly increased the importance of T20 cricket and franchise leagues.[65] The 21st century brought with it the Bangladesh Team, who made their Test debut in 2000. The game itself also grew, with a new format made up of 20-over innings being created. This format, called T20 cricket, quickly became a highly popular format, putting the longer formats at risk. The new shorter format also introduced franchise cricket, with new tournaments like the Indian Premier League and the Australian Big Bash League. The ICC has selected the T20 format as cricket's growth format, and has introduced a T20 World Cup which is played every two years;[66] T20 cricket has also been increasingly accepted into major events such as the Asian Games.[67] The resultant growth has seen cricket's fanbase cross one billion people, with 90% of them in South Asia.[2] T20's success has also spawned even shorter formats, such as 10-over cricket (T10) and 100-ball cricket, though not without controversy.[68] Outside factors have also taken their toll on cricket. For example, the 2008 Mumbai attacks led India and Pakistan to suspend their bilateral series indefinitely. The 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team during their tour of Pakistan led to Pakistan being unable to host matches until 2019.[69][70][71][72] In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th Test nations.[73][74] Laws and gameplay Main article: Laws of Cricket A typical cricket field In cricket, the rules of the game are codified in The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called \"the Laws\"), which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital \"L\"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744, and since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[75] Playing area Main articles: Cricket field, Cricket pitch, Crease (cricket), and Wicket Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image of cricket pitch and",

Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.[79] Cricket pitch and creases As illustrated, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a 12 ft (3.7 m) line (six feet on either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an 8 ft (2.4 m) line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.[80] Match structure Main article: Innings Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings.[81] \"Innings\" is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[81] In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batters.[82][83] When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.[81] During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time.[a] The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.[76] The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents, but in some forms of cricket, it is also",

G. Grace \"taking guard\" in 1883. His pads and bat are very similar to those used today. The gloves have evolved somewhat. Many modern players use more defensive equipment than were available to Grace, most notably helmets and arm guards. The wicket-keeper (a specialised fielder behind the batter) and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head, and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area).[87] Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.[88] Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. The kit is traditionally all white, and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket, but in limited overs cricket, team colours are now worn instead.[89] Bat and ball Main articles: Cricket bat and Cricket ball The three types of cricket balls used in international matches, all of the same size: i) A new white ball. White balls are mainly used in limited overs cricket, especially in matches played at night, under floodlights (left). ii) A new red ball. Red balls are used in day Test cricket, first-class cricket and some other forms of cricket (center). iii) A used pink ball. Pink balls are used in day/night Test cricket (right). The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from their end of the pitch towards the batter who, armed with a bat, is \"on strike\" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay). The bat is made of wood, usually Salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for",

There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).[90][91] The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva was legal, even when the polishing was deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air. The use of saliva has since been made illegal due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[92] The acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seams constitute illegal ball tampering.[93] Player roles Basic gameplay: bowler to batter During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.[94] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 1 Umpire 2 Wicket 3 Non-striking batter 4 Bowler 5 Ball 6 Pitch 7 Popping crease 8 Striking batter 9 Wicket 10 Wicket-keeper 11 First slip 12 Return crease In the photo, the two batters (3 and 8, wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6).

The other batter (3) at the bowling end is called the \"non-striker\". The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9), and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called \"first slip\" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batters and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear, including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).

The wicket-keeper is the only fielding player able to wear protective gloves. While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called \"square leg\", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or at least prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs. Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, so are termed all-rounders. Bowlers are classified according to their style and speed, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or spinners. Batters are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed, with switch-hitting uncommon and largely utilised as a tactic, where a batter changes stance shortly before the bowler releases the ball.[95] Overs Main article: Over (cricket) The Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\".[96] The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six legal balls (deliveries) have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\"; if the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate. The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the nonstriker's end and vice versa.[96] Fielding Main article: Fielding (cricket) Fielding positions in cricket for a right-handed batter Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.[88] If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of the aforementioned fielder, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[85] The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to",

The diagram for a left-handed batter is a mirror image of this one. Batters take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.[76] Substitute batters are generally not allowed,[97] except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[85] In order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.[99] A skilled batter can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat, it is called an \"edge\". The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicket-keeper. Equally, the batter does not have to attempt a run when hitting the ball with their bat. Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs by simply making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists, or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that the player has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batter's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", and \"pull\".[100] Sachin Tendulkar is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries. The batter on strike (i.e., the \"striker\") must prevent the ball from hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with their bat so that the batter and their partner have time to switch places, with each of them running from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball and attempt a run out (throwing the ball at one of the wickets before the run is scored.) To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run) before a fielder can throw",

To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run) before a fielder can throw the ball at the nearby wicket. Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[101] The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling, usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit. Hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[101] To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batters do not need to run.[102] Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball. Batters attempting a run while a fielder awaits a throw. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batters have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.[101] Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they break the rules (often by failing to bowl the ball before their front foot passes the popping crease at their end);[103] wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they bowl so that the ball is out of the batter's reach;[104] bye, an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way;[105] and leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter's body, though not their bat.[105] If the bowler has bowled an illegal delivery (i.e., a no-ball or a wide), the bowler's team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again, and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. In addition, the ways in which the batters can be dismissed on an illegal delivery greatly narrow down; in the case of a no-ball, which is the more egregious type of illegal delivery, the only common way in which the batters can be dismissed is by being run out.[103][104] Dismissals Main article: Dismissal (cricket) The umpire signaling a dismissal There are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed: five relatively common and four extremely rare.

When a batter is dismissed, they are said to have 'lost their wicket', and are barred from batting again in that inning; their team is also said to have 'lost a wicket'. Once a team has lost 10 wickets, its innings is over. Most common dismissals involve the wickets, such as when the ball is bowled at the striker's wicket. The common forms of dismissal are: bowled \u2013 when the striker fails to prevent a delivery from hitting their wicket[106] caught \u2013 when a ball struck by the bat is caught by a fielder before it hits the ground[107] leg before wicket \u2013 when the striker's body 'unfairly' prevents a delivery from hitting the wicket[108] run out \u2013 generally when the ball is thrown at a wicket by a fielder while the batters are running between the wickets[109] stumped \u2013 a special type of run out involving the wicket-keeper and striker[110] Rare methods are: hit wicket \u2013 a striker hitting their own wicket[111] hit the ball twice[112] obstructing the field[113] timed out \u2013 a batter failing to enter the field in a timely manner[114] The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give their decision. If the batter is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says \"Out!\"; otherwise, the umpire will shake their head and say \"Not out\".[115] There is, effectively, a tenth method of dismissal, retired out (self-dismissal - generally permanent except in cases of injury), which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.[116] Bowling Main article: Bowling (cricket) Bowlers generate momentum by running, and then release the ball upon reaching their \"delivery stride\".

These specialists bowl \"spells\" that are generally 4 to 8 overs long in order not to physically exhaust the bowler, cause muscle strain and stress the skeleton. The rules prevent a single bowler from bowling consecutive overs, resulting in at least two bowlers alternating each over. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.[96] The action of bowling the ball is akin to throwing, with the caveat that a bowler's elbow extension is almost entirely restricted, resulting in most bowlers maintaining a straight arm when releasing the ball during their delivery stride. Additionally, while the bowler is not required to pitch (bounce)",

    "chunk": "to throwing, with the caveat that a bowler's elbow extension is almost entirely restricted, resulting in most bowlers maintaining a straight arm when releasing the ball during their delivery stride. Additionally, while the bowler is not required to pitch (bounce) the ball, a full toss (non-bouncing) delivery that reaches the striker above waist height is penalised as a no-ball. A bowler reaches their delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts their run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\".[96] Fast bowlers, or pacemen, need momentum, taking a lengthy run up, while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph), and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter, who is forced to react very quickly.[117] Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.e., curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing their shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[117] At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler, who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter. A spinner will often \"buy their wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batter into making a poor shot. The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries, as the batter is often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as the batter expects it to, and the batter could be \"trapped\" into getting themself out. Accidental full toss deliveries can also get wickets, as the failure of the ball to bounce can surprise a batsman or induce a poor stroke in an effort to punish the poor delivery with a boundary hit.[118] In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium-paced seamers, who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter's concentration.[117] Specialist roles Main articles: Captain (cricket) and Wicket-keeper The wicket-keeper has gloves to receive deliveries that the striker fails to hit. He may also elect to wear protection such as leg guards and a helmet The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating their players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that the captain's players conduct themselves \"within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws\".[76] The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the \"keeper\") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws",

The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.[119] Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batters, and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.[120][121] Match closure Main article: Result (cricket) Match results are sometimes determined by a final dismissal, either because the batting team's last wicket falls, or in a limited-overs match, the chance to score is denied on the final delivery. There are a number of ways that a cricket match can end and its result be described, depending on whether the team batting first or last wins as well as the format of the game. If the team batting last is 'all out' having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have \"lost by n runs\" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by n wickets\", where n is the number of wickets left to fall (batters yet to be dismissed) until the team would have been all out. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) wins the match \"by four wickets\", since the team would only have been prevented from scoring the winning runs if four more of its batters had been dismissed, which would have resulted in all but one of its eleven batters being dismissed.[86] In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have \"won by an innings and n runs\" and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.[86] If the match has only a single innings per side, then usually a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number",

Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. In some cases, ties are broken by having each team bat for a one-over innings known as a Super Over; subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern (DLS) method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible, for example, wet weather.[86] In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue.[122] There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled, for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.[123] Innings Main article: Innings The final innings of the match generally ends when the batting team either scores the winning runs (known as reaching its target score) or runs out of \"resources\" (either losing 10 wickets or running out of time/overs to bat) and thus can not win. The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"At the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in\".[81] In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress. An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:[81] the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed, even though some of the captain's players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because the captain believes that their team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings the set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time in the final innings of the match, the batting",

Umpires and scorers Main articles: Umpire (cricket), Scoring (cricket), and Cricket statistics An umpire signals a decision to the scorers. The Adelaide Oval cricket scoreboard during an Ashes Test in Australia The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end and the other in a position called \"square leg\", which is about 15\u201320 m (49\u201366 ft) away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which that umpire is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities, including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batter is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How's that?\" or \"Howzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.[122] Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.[122] The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out (has been dismissed); the umpire raises both arms above their head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken, and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.[124] A match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks, and runs were originally called notches.[125] According to historian Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use.[126] It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.[127] Scores are displayed differently depending on location, although it is standard to show how many wickets have been lost and how many runs a team",

Within Australia, the format is Wickets/Runs, while in the rest of the world, the format is Runs/Wickets. For example, a score of 125 runs with 4 wickets lost would be displayed as 4/125 or 125/4, respectively.[128] Spirit of the Game Main article: Laws of Cricket Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the \"Spirit of Cricket\", a concept encompassing sportsmanship, fair play and mutual respect. This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined. Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000, a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game. The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line:[129] Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket. The Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the \"positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork\".[130] Its second line states that, \"the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents\".[129] The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player. Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batter is not out), but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids trying to enumerate the diverse cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship, or its absence.[clarification needed] Women's cricket Main article: Women's cricket Mithali Raj of India is the highest run scorer in women's international cricket. Women's cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745.[131] International development began at the start of the 20th century, and the first Test match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.[132] The following year, New Zealand joined them, and in 2007 Netherland became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa. In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005).[132] In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England.[132] In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket.

The (highest level) Test playing nations are shown in red; the associate member nations are shown in orange, with those with ODI status in a darker shade; suspended or former members are shown in dark grey. The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989.[132] The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket.[134] The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.[135] In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.[136] The table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:[137] Cricket governing bodies Nation Governing body Full Member since[138] Afghanistan Afghanistan Cricket Board 22 June 2017 Australia Cricket Australia 15 July 1909 Bangladesh Bangladesh Cricket Board 26 June 2000 England England and Wales Cricket Board 15 July 1909 India Board of Control for Cricket in India 31 May 1926 Ireland Cricket Ireland 22 June 2017 New Zealand New Zealand Cricket 31 May 1926 Pakistan Pakistan Cricket Board 28 July 1952 South Africa Cricket South Africa 15 July 1909 Sri Lanka Sri Lanka Cricket 21 July 1981 West Indies Cricket West Indies 31 May 1926 Zimbabwe Zimbabwe Cricket 6 July 1992 Forms of cricket Main article: Forms of cricket A Test match between South Africa and England in January 2005.

Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876\u201377 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.[139] Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each. There are two main types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three to four hours, usually in an evening session. The first Twenty20 World Championship was held in 2007. In addition, a few full-member cricket boards have decided to start leagues that are played in the T10 format,[140][141][142][143] in which games are intended to last approximately 90 minutes.[144][145] Most recently, in 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) introduced a new league featuring a hundred-ball tournament, known as The Hundred.[146] Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".[147][148] Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batter in at a time, and that batter must face every delivery bowled while their innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.[149] Competitions Cricket match in Kerava, Finland, 2011 Cricket is played at both the international and domestic level.

Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes. The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019. A league competition for ODIs, the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020 and lasted only for one edition. The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket. Competitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier.

Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular.[156] Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events.[157] The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.[158] Y.M.C.A. women playing cricket as part of 'sports for troops', Sydney University, 23 April 1941 The Old Baltimore Cricket Club, 1927 Rivalries Main page: Category:Cricket rivalries Culture Main page: Category:Cricket culture Influence on everyday life Street cricket being played in a village in the Himalayas of India Plaquita, a game similar to cricket, being played in the Dominican Republic Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as \"that's not cricket\" (that's unfair), \"had a good innings\" (lived a long life), and \"sticky wicket\". \"On a sticky wicket\" (aka \"sticky dog\" or \"glue pot\")[159] is a metaphor[160] used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.[161] In the arts and popular culture See also: Cricket in fiction, Cricket in film and television, and Cricket poetry Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron.[162] Beyond a Boundary (1963), written by Trinidadian C. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written.[163] In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The cricketers (1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\"[164] French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s.[162] Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batter in motion.[162] Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan's cricket images[165] are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's \"World of Invention\" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1\u20133 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[166] In music, many calypsos make reference to the Sport of Cricket.

See List of calypso songs about cricket. Influence on other sports Tom Wills, cricketer and co-founder of Australian football Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.[167] In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.[168] It is typically played on modified cricket fields.[169] An 1876 baseball box score In England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months. Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884;[170] Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams.[171] Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.[172] In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score[173] (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the Clipper.[174] The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as \"the Father of Baseball\" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.[175] The influence of cricket and other English sports in British India resulted in the local sports becoming standardised by the 1920s.[176] The 21st century success of the Indian Premier League also inspired the growth of other sports leagues in India,[177] with some of the native sports being further modernised, as with the popular Pro Kabaddi League.[178] See also Cricket portal Sports portal Glossary of cricket terms Willow and Stumpy Related sports Baseball Comparison of baseball and cricket Stoolball Street cricket Footnotes ^ The term \"amateur\" in this context does not mean someone who played cricket in his spare time. Many amateurs in first-class cricket were full-time players during the cricket season. Some of the game's greatest players, including W. G. Grace, held amateur status. ^ The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting their ability to run; in this case, the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs,[84] though this does not apply in international cricket.[85] Citations ^ Sensharma, Agastya (4 January 2024). \"Cricket: A Gentleman's Game\".

The president would almost certainly veto it. President Donald Trump listens during an event in the East Room of the White House on Feb. 11. | Evan Vucci/AP By DANIEL DESROCHERS and MEREDITH LEE HILL 02/11/2026 06:27 PM EST Updated: 02/11/2026 08:37 PM EST The House on Wednesday voted to block President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, with six Republicans joining the Democrats in the symbolic rebuke. The resolution to disapprove of the national emergency Trump declared to raise tariffs on Canada, was approved 219-211. Republican Reps. Kevin Kiley of California, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Jeff Hurd of Colorado and Dan Newhouse of Washington voted for the resolution. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the only Democrat to vote against the measure. Trump threatened those in his party who voted against his tariffs in a Truth Social post moments before the vote was finalized. \u201cAny Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cTARIFFS have given us Great National Security because the mere mention of the word has Countries agreeing to our strongest wishes. TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.\u201d The resolution now goes to the Senate, where it could pass; the upper chamber has already approved two similar resolutions on Trump\u2019s Canada tariffs with the support of four Republicans. But the president would certainly veto it, and Congress is unlikely to muster the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to overturn a veto. Even so, House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to block the vote from happening at all, fearing the political fallout for his GOP members. Trump\u2019s tariffs have proven politically unpopular over the past year \u2014 a POLITICO poll even found that self-identified MAGA Republicans are split on them \u2014 and Democrats have overperformed in off-year and special election campaigns that have focused on affordability. Both Hurd and Newhouse said they voted for the resolution because the tariffs are hurting businesses in their home states \u2014 and because they felt Congress should have control over trade policy. \u201cCongress should not tie its own hands on our Constitutional authority to levy tariffs,\u201d Newshouse said in a post on social media. \u201cWhile I understand the President\u2019s approach to utilize tariffs as leverage to secure more trade deals, the fact of the matter remains the tariffs on Canada have harmed Washingtonians.\u201d Republican leadership urged members to wait to weigh in on tariffs until the Supreme Court determines whether Trump overstepped his authority by implementing the tariffs, a ruling that could come as soon as next week. But Johnson\u2019s bid to restart House Republicans\u2019 nearly yearlong blockade on tariff votes failed Tuesday, after a handful of Republican members joined Democrats in rejecting a procedural maneuver",

The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance the ball at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense. If they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. In the case of a tie after four quarters, the game enters overtime.

    "chunk": "football game was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time; by 1875, the sport had adopted rules similar to rugby union. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football\", established concepts that would define the sport, among them the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, and specified the size and shape of the football. The modern sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game; the two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football. American football is the most popular sport in the United States; the most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high school and youth football. Over a million Americans played college or high school football in 2022, and the National Football League (NFL) has one of the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events globally. Other professional and amateur leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball; the sport maintains a growing following in the rest of North America, Europe, Brazil, and Japan. Flag football, a variant of the sport, will be played at the 2028 Summer Olympics. Etymology and names Main article: Football (word) In the United States, American football is referred to as \"football\".[4] The term \"football\" was officially established in the rulebook for the 1876 college football season, when the sport first shifted from soccer-style rules to rugby-style rules. Although it could easily have been called \"rugby\" at this point, Harvard, one of the primary proponents of the rugby-style game, compromised and did not request the name of the sport be changed to \"rugby\".[5] The terms \"gridiron\" or \"American football\" are favored in English-speaking countries where other types of football are popular, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.[6][7] History Main articles: History of American football and American football in the United States Part of the American football series on the History of American football Origins of American football Early historyModern historyFirst gameFirst pro leagueFirst pro playerWalter Camp Close relations to other codes AustralianBoston gameCanadianMedievalOld divisionRugby leagueRugby unionSoccer Topics Black players in professional footballCanadian football comparisonConcussionsGlossaryHall of Fame (College)Hall of Fame (Pro)HomosexualityRugby league comparisonRugby union comparisonYears College seasonsNFL seasons American football Portal vte Early history Main article: Early history of American football American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer.

They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head, or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6\u20134.[9][10] Collegiate play continued for several years with games played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873, to create a standard set of rules for use by all schools. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122 m \u00d7 76 m) were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.[10] After playing McGill University using American rules (known as \"the Boston game\") for the first game and Canadian (rugby) rules for the second one,[10][11] the Harvard players preferred the Canadian style of having only 11 men on the field, running the ball without having to be chased by an opponent, the forward pass, tackling, and using an oblong instead of a round ball.[12][13] An 1875 Harvard\u2013Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two Princeton athletes who were impressed by it. They introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the Professional Football Researchers Association compared to \"selling refrigerators to Eskimos\".[10] Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system.[14] These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player Walter Camp, now regarded as the \"Father of American Football\",[14][15] secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap to replace the chaotic and inconsistent scrum.[14] While the game between Rutgers and Princeton is commonly considered the first American football game, several years prior in 1862, the Oneida Football Club formed as the oldest known football club in the United States. The team consisted of graduates of Boston's elite preparatory schools and played from 1862 to 1865.[16] Evolution of the game Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football\", in 1878 when Camp was captain of Yale University's football team The dangers associated with the sport depicted in a 1908 cartoon by William Charles Morris The introduction of the snap resulted in an unexpected consequence. Before the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in a bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, in a game between Yale and Princeton, both",

    "chunk": "a bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, in a game between Yale and Princeton, both teams used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0\u20130 tie. This \"block game\" proved extremely unpopular with both teams' spectators and fans.[14] A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three downs, or tackles, to advance the ball 5 yards (4.6 m). Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a gridiron in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to 110 by 53 + 1\u20443 yards (100.6 m \u00d7 48.8 m) and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown, and five for a goal from the field. Additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized,[14] and a static line of scrimmage was instituted.[17] Despite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.[18] A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made.[19] In response, 62 colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905. These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[20] The legal forward pass was introduced in 1906, although its effect was initially minimal due to the restrictions placed on its use. The idea of a 40-yard-wider field was opposed by Harvard due to the size of the new Harvard Stadium.[21] Other rule changes introduced that year included the reduction of playing time from 70 to 60 minutes and an increase of the distance required for a first down from 5 to 10 yards (4.6 to 9.1 m). To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the neutral zone was created along the width of the football before the snap.[22] Scoring was also adjusted: points awarded for field goals were reduced to three in 1909[15] and points for touchdowns were raised to six in 1912.[23] Also in 1912, the field was shortened to 100 yards (91 m) long, two 10-yard-long (9.1 m) end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1 m).[24][25] The roughing the passer penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first",

This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not prohibited outright.[27] Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.[28] By 1922, the NFL had established itself as America's premier professional football league.[29] The dominant form of football at the time was played at the collegiate level. The upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925, however, when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons, defeated a team of Notre Dame all-stars in an exhibition game.[30] A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to distinguish itself further from the college game during the late 1930s.[28] Football, in general, became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants, still referred to as the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". The game, a 23\u201317 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major influence on the popularity of the sport. By the mid-1960s, football was the most popular sport in the United States.[31] In 1972, polling from Gallup, Inc. found that twice as many Americans identified football as their favorite sport (38%) as compared to baseball (19%); the sport has remained the most popular in the United States since.[32] In 1960, the American Football League (AFL) was created to compete with the NFL. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the ABC television network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to professional football in the United States and actively recruited minority players. The AFL also signed",

Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to professional football in the United States and actively recruited minority players. The AFL also signed several star college players who had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record $437,000 contract (equivalent to $4.36 million in 2024). A five-year, $40 million NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966 when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that took full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. This championship game, which would come to be known as the Super Bowl, began play at the end of the 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues, instead being competed between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC).[33] Modern era of college football Prior to the 1956 college football season, NCAA schools were organized into an upper University Division and lower College Division. In the summer of 1973, the University Division became Division I, but by 1976, there was a desire to further separate the major football programs from those that were less financially successful, while still allowing their other sports to compete at the top level.[34] In 1978, the NCAA divided Division I football into two subdivisions: NCAA Division I-A (known today as the Football Bowl Subdivision, or FBS) and Division I-AA (known today as the Football Championship Subdivision, or FCS).[35] The FCS adopted a single-elimination playoff structure to determine its champion, while the FBS retained its tradition of postseason bowl games.[36] Each bowl game was associated with a particular conference, and earning a spot in a major bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was beneficial to both conferences and bowl games, but it generally prevented the top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game.[37] Because the NCAA itself does not officially sanction a Division I-FBS national champion, FBS national champions prior to 1992 were determined by polls, which frequently led to controversial or \"split\" national champions.[38] In 1992, the Bowl Coalition was created to determine the national champion. It was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which itself gave way to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) in 1997.[37] All three of these systems consisted of a single national championship game, as well as a set of other major bowl games.[38] In 2014, the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP), a single-elimination tournament.[39][40] In another major change, in 2021, following legal pressure and antitrust lawsuits, the NCAA and its conferences began allowing schools to offer compensation to student athletes for the",

NCAA allowed schools to directly pay players, ending the traditionally amateur nature of college athletics in the United States.[42] Teams and positions Main article: American football positions A diagram of a typical pre-snap formation. The offense (red) is lined up in a variation of the I formation, while the defense (blue) is lined up in the 4\u20133 defense. Both formations are legal. A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each.[43][44][45] Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty.[43][46][47][nb 2] Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs;[49][50][51] this \"platoon\" system has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams units.[52] The number of players allowed on an active roster varies by league; the NFL has a 53-man roster,[53] while NCAA Division I allows teams to have up to 105 players on their roster.[54] Individual players in a football game must be designated with a uniform number between 0 and 99. NFL teams are required to number their players by a league-approved numbering system, and any exceptions must be approved by the commissioner.[43] NCAA and NFHS teams are \"strongly advised\" to number their offensive players according to a league-suggested numbering scheme.[55][56] Women are eligible to play in high school, college, and professional football, but most football players are men. No woman has ever played in the NFL, but women have played in high school and college football games.[57] In 2018, women and girls comprised 0.5% of players in Pop Warner Little Scholars youth football,[58] 0.2% of players in high school football,[59] and 10.9% of Americans who report playing tackle football.[58] Offensive unit A quarterback for the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes in Germany under center and ready to take the snap The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown.[60] The offensive team must line up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50\u201379 on the offensive line.[44][61][62] Players can line up temporarily in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they report the change immediately to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change.[63] Neither team's players, except the center (C), are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.[64] The main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), running back (RB), and fullback (FB).

    "chunk": "not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.[64] The main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), running back (RB), and fullback (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either the quarterback or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it, or runs with it.[60] The primary role of the running back is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage or goal-line situations.[65] They are seldom used as receivers.[66] The offensive line (OL) consists of several players whose primary function is to block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays.[65] The most important role on the offensive line is the center, who is not just responsible for blocking and snapping the ball, but also for handling line adjustments and pre-snap strategy.[67] On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards. The principal receivers are the wide receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE).[68] Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback,[65] but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.[65] Defensive unit Defensive players with the Dallas Cowboys forcing Arian Foster, a running back with the Houston Texans, to fumble the ball. The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers. Turnovers include interceptions (a defender catching a forward pass intended for the offense) and forced fumbles (taking possession of the ball from the ball-carrier).[60] The defensive line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles are to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.[65] Linebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers tend to serve as the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays, given their vantage point of the offensive backfield. Their roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and tackling backs, wide receivers, and tight ends in the passing game.[69] The defensive backfield, often called the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are",

Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS).[65] Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite a receiver to be able to cover them. Safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties tend to be viewed as \"the last line of defense\" and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as breakout running plays.[65] Special teams unit Tampa Bay Buccaneers placekicker Connor Barth attempts a field goal by kicking the ball from the hands of a holder. This is the standard method to score field goals or extra points.[70] The special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball tries to execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts, and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.[60] Three positions are specific to the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H), and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).[71] The positions specific to punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, upback, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR)\u2014the player who catches the punt. Upbacks line up a short distance behind the line of scrimmage, providing additional protection to the punter.[72] Rules Main article: American football rules Scoring A player for the Navy Midshipmen (dark jersey) scores a touchdown while a defender from the Tulsa Golden Hurricane (in white) looks on. The goal line is marked by the small orange pylon. In football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game. The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone.[60] The scoring team then attempts a try, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT) or conversion, which is a single scoring opportunity. If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is",

If the PAT is scored by a place kick or drop kick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point. If the PAT is scored by what would normally be a touchdown, it is worth two points; this is known as a two-point conversion. In general, the extra point is almost always successful, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.[73] A field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is place kicked or drop kicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.[74][75][76] Almost all field goal attempts are done via place kick. While drop kicks were common in the early days of the sport, the shape of modern footballs makes it difficult to reliably drop kick the ball. The last successful scoring play by drop kick in the NFL was accomplished in 2006; prior to that, the last successful drop kick had been made in 1941.[77] After a PAT attempt or successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.[78] A safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in the carrier's own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.[60] In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick.[79] Safeties are the least common method of scoring in football.[80] Field and equipment Main article: American football field The football field at The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis as seen from behind one end zone. The tall, yellow goal posts mark where the ball must pass for a successful field goal or extra point. The large, rectangular area marked with the team name is the end zone. An American football. Football games are played on a rectangular field that measures 120 yards (110 m) long and 53 + 1\u20443 yards (48.8 m) wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known as the end lines and sidelines. Goal lines are marked 10 yards (9.1 m) inward from each end line.[81][82][83] Weighted pylons are placed along each sideline, on the inside corner of the intersections with the goal lines and end lines. White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone. Inbound lines, or hash marks, are short parallel lines that mark off 1-yard (0.91 m) increments. Yard lines, which can run the width of the field, are marked every 5 yards (4.6 m). A one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.[81][82][83] Goalposts are located at the center of the",

Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.[81][82][83] Goalposts are located at the center of the plane of the two end lines. The crossbar of these posts is 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar 18 feet 6 inches (5.64 m) apart for professional and collegiate play, and 23 feet 4 inches (7.11 m) apart for high school play.[84][85][86] The uprights extend vertically 35 feet (11 m) on professional fields, a minimum of 10 yards (9.1 m) on college fields, and a minimum of 10 feet (3.0 m) on high school fields. Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are normally placed at the tip of each upright as indicators of wind strength and direction.[84][85][86] The football itself is a prolate spheroid leather ball, similar to the balls used in rugby or Australian rules football.[87] At all levels of play, the football is inflated to 12 + 1\u20442 to 13 + 1\u20442 psi (86 to 93 kPa), or just under one atmosphere, and weighs 14 to 15 ounces (400 to 430 g);[86][88][89] beyond that, the exact dimensions vary slightly. In professional play the ball has a long axis of 11 to 11 + 1\u20444 inches (28 to 29 cm), a long circumference of 28 to 28 + 1\u20442 inches (71 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of 21 to 21 + 1\u20444 inches (53 to 54 cm).[89] In college and high school play the ball has a long axis of 10 + 7\u20448 to 11 + 7\u204416 inches (27.6 to 29.1 cm), a long circumference of 27 + 3\u20444 to 28 + 1\u20442 inches (70 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of 20 + 3\u20444 to 21 + 1\u20444 inches (53 to 54 cm).[86][88] Duration and time stoppages Football games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided into two halves of 30 minutes and four quarters of 15 minutes.[90][91] High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two halves of 24 minutes and four quarters of 12 minutes.[92] The two halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are followed by a short break.[90][91][93] Before the game starts, the referee and each team's captain meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team can call either \"heads\" or \"tails\"; the winner of the toss chooses whether to receive or kick off the ball or which goal they wish to defend. They can defer their choice until the second half. Unless the winning team decides to defer, the losing team chooses the option the winning team did not select\u2014to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to defend.[94]",

Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to defend.[94] Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters.[95] If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.[96][97][98] If certain fouls are committed during play while time has expired, the quarter may be extended through an untimed down.[99] Games last longer than their defined length due to play stoppages\u2014the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours.[100] Time in a football game is measured by the game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official.[90][101] A separate play clock is used to show the amount of time within which the offense must initiate a play. The play clock is set to 25 seconds after certain administrative stoppages in play and to 40 seconds when play is proceeding without such stoppages. If the offense fails to start a play before the play clock reads \"00\", a delay of game foul is called on the offense.[96][102][103] Advancing the ball and downs Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme (number 17) in the motion of throwing a forward pass There are two main ways the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the center passes the ball backwards and between their legs to the quarterback in a process known as the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a running back, throws the ball, or runs with it. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out-of-bounds or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can be legally attempted only if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage; only one forward pass can be attempted per down.[78] As in rugby, players can also pass the ball backwards at any point during a play.[104] In the NFL, a down also ends immediately if the runner's helmet comes off.[105] The offense is given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from farther down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might attempt to score a field goal instead.[78] A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements.[106] The spot needed to secure a first down is known as the line to gain.[107] On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the line to gain to the",

The ball may be drop kicked or place kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or a tee; a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop kick or place kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball. The ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.[117][118][119] The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points.[74][75][76] The place kick is the standard method used to score points,[70] because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop kick.[70] Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched.[120][121][122] The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball. The receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch, which prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver. The play ends as soon as the ball is caught, and the ball may not be advanced.[123][124][125] Officials and fouls See also: Official (American football), Chain crew, and Penalty (gridiron football) Officials meeting at midfield Officials in a game between Eastern Washington and Cal Berkeley use the chains to measure for a first down. Here, the ball is just short of the pole and therefore short of a first down. A modern down indicator box is mounted on a pole and is used to mark the current line of scrimmage. The number on the marker is changed using a dial. Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock.

All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a weighted yellow flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.[126] Women can serve as officials; Sarah Thomas became the NFL's first female official in 2015.[127] The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the college level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:[126] The referee: is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs. The referee is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any rule interpretations in discussions among the other officials. The referee announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected. The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of the quarterback. In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a play from scrimmage. The umpire: is positioned in the defensive backfield, except in the NFL, where the umpire is positioned lateral to the referee on the opposite side of the formation. The umpire watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field before the snap, and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. The umpire monitors contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and game score. They also assist the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determine whether player equipment is legal, and dry wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain. The back judge: is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire. The back judge ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a pass interference violation occurred. The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time between each play, when a visible play clock is not used. The head linesman/down judge: is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage. The head linesman/down judge watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman/down judge also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew, and",

The head linesman/down judge also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew, and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead. The side judge: is positioned twenty yards downfield of the head linesman. The side judge mainly duplicates the functions of the field judge. On field goal and extra point attempts, the side judge is positioned lateral to the umpire. The line judge: is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. They supervise player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. The line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper. The field judge: is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line judge. The field judge monitors and controls the play clock, counts the number of defensive players on the field, and watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive players. The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of scrimmage. On field goal and extra point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the upright opposite the back judge. The center judge: is an eighth official used only in the top level of college football. The center judge stands lateral to the referee, the same way the umpire does in the NFL. The center judge is responsible for spotting the football after each play and has many of the same responsibilities as the referee, except announcing penalties. Another set of officials, the chain crew, are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials, they will briefly bring the chains onto the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people\u2014two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.[106] Safety and brain health See also: Protective equipment in gridiron football and Health issues in American football Vince Agnew, then with the Miami Dolphins, wearing a",

Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players.[128] To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet and a set of shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards.[129][130][131] Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions.[128] Repeated concussions (and possibly sub-concussive head impacts[132]) can increase a person's risk in later life for CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression.[133] Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures.[134] Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's \"Heads Up Football\" program aims to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact.[135] However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.[136] A 2018 study performed by the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Boston University School of Medicine found that tackle football before age 12 was correlated with earlier onset of symptoms of CTE, but not with symptom severity. More specifically, each year a player played tackle football under age 12 predicted earlier onset of cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems by an average of two and a half years.[137][138][139] To help mitigate injuries, the NCAA recommends limiting full contact (tackling to the ground) practices, avoiding full contact on consecutive days, and no more than 20 hours of practice per week. Players must receive one day off per week.[140] Leagues and tournaments See also: Comparisons between the National Football League and NCAA football A high school football game at New Canaan High School in New Canaan, Connecticut The National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are the most popular football leagues in the United States.[141] The National Football League was founded in 1920[142] and has since become the largest and most popular sport in the United States.[143] The NFL has the highest average attendance of any sporting league in the world, with an average attendance of 66,960 during the 2011 NFL",

The NFHS is the largest organization for high school football, with member associations in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia. USA Football is the governing body for youth and amateur football,[152] and Pop Warner Little Scholars is the largest organization for youth football.[153] Other professional leagues Rival leagues The most successful league to directly compete with the NFL was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in 1964 before signing a five-year, US$36 million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began signing NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all the AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), was in play from 1946 to 1949. After it had dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.[154] Other attempts to start rival leagues since the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970 have been far less successful, as professional football salaries and the NFL's television contracts began to escalate out of the reach of competitors and the NFL covered more of the larger cities. The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced such severe monetary issues it could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before the season could be completed.[155] The United States",

In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before the season could be completed.[155] The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985. Originally not intended as a rival league, the entry of owners who sought marquee talent and to challenge the NFL led to an escalation in salaries and ensuing financial losses. A subsequent US$1.5 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only $1 in damages, which was automatically tripled to $3 under antitrust law.[156] Complementary national leagues The original XFL, created in 2001 by WWE co-founder Vince McMahon, lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN, and high expectations, the XFL suffered from low quality of play and poor reception for its use of tawdry professional wrestling gimmicks, which caused initially high ratings and attendance to collapse.[157] The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009 but folded after suspending its 2012 season after having lost $120 million over just three seasons.[158] Another spring league, the Alliance of American Football lasted less than one season, unable to keep investors.[159] The XFL was rebooted in 2020;[160] after only five weeks of play, the league's operations slowly came to a close due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,[161] The league filed for bankruptcy on April 13[162] and was purchased by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, along with longtime business partner and ex-wife Dany Garcia.[163] A revived United States Football League began play in 2022[164] and quickly faced immediate competition from the XFL, which resumed play in 2023.[165][166] The two leagues merged following the 2023 season, forming a new United Football League (UFL).[167] International play Players with one of the youth divisions of the Borregos Salvajes football program of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Mexico City American football leagues exist throughout the world, but the game has yet to achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball.[168] At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier. These countries rank far below the United States, which is dominant at the international level.[169] NFL Europa, the developmental league of the NFL, operated from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 2007. At the time of its closure, NFL Europa had five teams based in Germany and one in the Netherlands.[170] In Germany, the German Football League (GFL) has 16 teams and has operated for over 40 seasons, with the league's championship game, the German Bowl, closing out each season. The league operates in a promotion and relegation structure with German Football League 2 (GFL2), which also has 16 teams.[171] The United Kingdom also operated several teams within NFL Europe during the League's tenure.[172] The resulting rise in popularity of the sport brought the NFL back to the country in 2007 where they",

Large team sizes were an additional difficulty, due to the Olympics' set limit of 10,500 athletes and coaches. American football also faced an issue with a lack of global visibility. Nigel Melville, the CEO of USA Rugby, noted that \"American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally.\" To solve these concerns, major effort was put into promoting flag football, a modified version of American football, at the international level.[169] Flag football for men and women will debut as an Olympic sport at the 2028 Summer Olympics.[188] Popularity and cultural influence United States Main article: American football in the United States The Boise State Broncos, the first football team to design a blue field \"Baseball is still called the national pastime, but football is by far the more popular sport in American society\", according to ESPN.com's Sean McAdam.[189] In a 2014 poll conducted by Harris Interactive, professional football ranked as the most popular sport, and college football ranked third behind only professional football and baseball; 46% of participants ranked some form of the game as their",

Professional football has ranked as the most popular sport in the poll since 1985, when it surpassed baseball for the first time.[190] Professional football is most popular among those who live in the eastern United States and rural areas, while college football is most popular in the southern United States and among people with graduate and post-graduate degrees.[191] Football is also the most-played sport by high school and college athletes in the United States. A 2022 survey from National Football Foundation found that one million high-school athletes played the sport, with another 81,000 college athletes across both the NCAA and the NAIA.[192] The Super Bowl is the most popular single-day sporting event in the United States,[33] and is among the biggest club sporting events in the world in terms of TV viewership.[145] The NFL made approximately $12 billion in revenue in 2022.[193] Super Bowl games account for eight of the top ten most-watched broadcasts in American history; Super Bowl LVII, played on February 12, 2023, was watched by a record 115.1 million Americans,[194] and is second only to the Apollo 11 moon landing (125 million viewers).[195] The NFL is the most valuable sports league in the world, with the average team valued at over $8 billion.[196] American football also plays a significant role in American culture. The day on which the Super Bowl is held is considered a de facto national holiday,[197] and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion.[198][199] Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date so as not to conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule.[200] Thanksgiving football is another American tradition,[201] hosting many high school, college, and professional games.[202] Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.[203] Other countries See also: American football in Australia, American football in Brazil, American football in Japan, and American football in the United Kingdom Opening ceremony of the 2010 NFL International Series at London's Wembley Stadium A 2012 football game between national teams of Finland and Sweden at Sonera Stadium (now Bolt Arena) in Helsinki In Canada, the game has a significant following. According to a 2013 poll, 21% of respondents said they followed the NFL \"very closely\" or \"fairly closely\", making it the third-most followed league behind the National Hockey League (NHL) and Canadian Football League (CFL).[204] American football also has a long history in Mexico, which was introduced to the sport in 1896.

Some teams in the X-League, like the Panasonic Impulse, are sponsored by corporations, and all Japanese players on these teams are employed by the corporation. The league operates in separate spring and fall seasons, with each team playing five games. The top eight teams make the playoffs, which are played in Tokyo Dome; the champion is determined by the Rice Bowl.[210] Europe is a major target for the expansion of the game by football organizers. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the sport was popular, with the 1986 Super Bowl being watched by over four million people (about 1 out of every 14 Britons). Its popularity faded during the 1990s, coinciding with the establishment of the Premier League \u2014 the top level of the English association football (soccer) league system. According to BBC America, there is a \"social stigma\" surrounding American football in the UK, with many Brits feeling the sport has no right to call itself \"football\" due to the lack of emphasis on kicking.[211] Nonetheless, the sport has retained a following in the United Kingdom; the NFL operates a media network in the country, and since 2007 has hosted the NFL International Series in London. Super Bowl viewership has also rebounded, with over 4.4 million Britons watching Super Bowl XLVI.[212] The sport is played in European countries like Switzerland, which has American football clubs in every major city,[213] and Germany, where the sport has around 45,000 registered amateur players.[207] In Brazil, football is a growing sport. It was generally unknown there until the 1980s when a small group of players began playing on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The sport grew gradually with 700 amateur players registering within 20 years. Games were played on the beach with modified rules and without the traditional football equipment due to its lack of availability in Brazil.

Eventually, a tournament, the Carioca championship, was founded, with the championship Carioca Bowl played to determine a league champion. The country saw its first full-pad game of football in October 2008.[214] According to The Rio Times, the sport is one of the fastest-growing sports in Brazil and is almost as commonly played as soccer on the beaches of Copacabana and Botafogo.[215] Football in Brazil is governed by the Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Futebol Americano (CBFA), which had over 5,000 registered players as of November 2013. The sport's increase in popularity has been attributed to games aired on ESPN, which began airing in Brazil in 1992 with Portuguese commentary.[216] The popularity and \"easy accessibility\" of non-contact versions of the sport in Brazil has led to a rise in participation by female players.[215] According to ESPN, the American football audience in Brazil increased 800% between 2013 and 2016. The network, along with Esporte Interativo, airs games there on cable television. NFL had expressed interest in having games in the country, eventually resulting in S\u00e3o Paulo's Arena Corinthians hosting Brazil's first NFL game in 2024,[217] and the Super Bowl has become a widely watched event in Brazil at bars and movie theaters.[218] Further countries have also expressed interest in football to a lesser degree. The Arab world has expressed growing interest in American football, with many countries in the region being members of IFAF Asia. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which are not members of IFAF, have established their own domestic leagues. Egypt established two leagues for the sport, namely the Egyptian League of American Football and the Egyptian Federation of American Football, and Saudi Arabia hosts two teams based out of Jeddah and Yanbu respectively.[219][220] China has additionally been a target for the expansion of the sport, with the Mainland being the home of the Chinese National Football League as well as a growing audience of Super Bowl watchers. Three franchises are also based out of Hong Kong, which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic regularly played mainland teams. NFL games average 900,000 viewers in China, though the league has cited logistical challenges which would prevent teams from playing games akin to abroad games in European countries.[221] Related sports and variations Canadian football Men playing a game of flag football at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island Canadian football, the predominant form of football in Canada, is closely related to American football\u2014both sports developed from rugby and are considered to be the chief variants of gridiron football.[222] Although both games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures 150 by 65 yards (137 by 59 m), including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards),[223] teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven,[224] fair catches are not",

The Indoor Football League is an example of a prominent indoor league.[234] The Arena Football League, which was founded in 1987 and ceased operations in 2019, was one of the longest-lived indoor football leagues.[235] In 2004, the league was called \"America's fifth major sport\" by ESPN The Magazine.[236] Some schools that lack the enrollment numbers to run a competitive 11-man team choose to play nine-man, eight-man, or six-man football, which utilize modified rules to account for smaller team sizes.[237][238][239][240] Another variation played at some universities, sprint football, limits the maximum weight of players;[241] as of 2022, the maximum weight allowed is 178 pounds (81 kg) [242] There are several non-contact variants of football, such as flag football.[243] In flag football the ball-carrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim to pull a flag tied around the ball-carrier's waist.[244] Flag football has become increasingly popular due to its lower likelihood of head injuries and its openness to female athletes; according to the NFL, which promotes flag football through NFL Flag, roughly 25% of flag football players are women and girls.[245] Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ball-carrier to be touched to be considered downed. Depending on the rules used, a game of touch football may require the ball-carrier be touched with either one or two hands to be considered downed.[246] Wheelchair football is a parasport adapting the rules of football for people with physical disabilities.[247] Although it uses touch rules instead of tackling,",

However, extensive investigations by reputable sources, including the U.S. government and scientific organizations, have found no evidence of unusual activity, attributing reported incidents to natural phenomena, human error, and misinterpretation.[1][2][3] Origins Map that was published in various newspapers with the Associated Press article of 17 September 1950 Although the nearby Sargasso Sea already had a reputation as a mysterious region where ships may become lost,[4] the earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones of the Miami Herald that was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in various American newspapers on 17 September 1950.[5][6][7] Two years later, Fate magazine published \"Sea Mystery at Our Back Door\": a short article, by George X. Sand, that was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place.[8] Sand recounted the loss of several planes and ships since World War II: the disappearance of Sandra, a tramp steamer;[a] the December 1945 loss of Flight 19, a group of five US Navy torpedo bombers on a training mission; the January 1948 disappearance of Star Tiger, a British South American Airways (BSAA) passenger airplane; the March 1948 disappearance of a fishing skiff with three men, including jockey Albert Snider;[b] the December 1948 disappearance of an Airborne Transport DC-3 charter flight en route from Puerto Rico to Miami; and the January 1949 disappearance of Star Ariel,[c] another BSAA passenger airplane.[8] Flight 19 was covered again in the April 1962 issue of The American Legion Magazine.[11][12] In it, author Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, \"We cannot be sure of any direction ... everything is wrong ... strange ... the ocean doesn't look as it should.\"[12] In February 1964, Vincent Gaddis wrote an",

    "chunk": "Allan W. Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, \"We cannot be sure of any direction ... everything is wrong ... strange ... the ocean doesn't look as it should.\"[12] In February 1964, Vincent Gaddis wrote an article called \"The Deadly Bermuda Triangle\" in Argosy saying Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region, dating back to at least 1840.[13][14] The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, Invisible Horizons.[15] Other writers elaborated on Gaddis' ideas, including John Wallace Spencer (Limbo of the Lost, 1969, repr. 1973);[16] Charles Berlitz (The Bermuda Triangle, 1974);[17] and Richard Winer (The Devil's Triangle, 1974).[18] Various of these authors incorporated supernatural elements.[19] Triangle area Sand's article in Fate described the area as \"a watery triangle bounded roughly by Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico\".[8]: 12 The Argosy article by Gaddis further delineated the boundaries,[13] giving its vertices as Miami, San Juan, and Bermuda. Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.[20] Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 1.3 to 3.9 million km2 (0.50 to 1.51 million sq mi).[20] \"Indeed, some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast,\" according to a 1977 BBC program.[2] Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.[20] Criticism of the concept Larry Kusche Larry Kusche, author of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved (1975),[1] argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an Atlantic port when in fact it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the Pacific Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events, like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories. Kusche concluded: The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean. In an area prone to tropical cyclones, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, not disproportionate, unlikely, or mysterious. Berlitz and other writers often failed to mention such storms and sometimes even represented the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this. The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return",

The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been. Some alleged disappearances were, in reality, not mysterious. Berlitz found that one plane believed to have disappeared in 1937 had, in fact, crashed off Daytona Beach, Florida, in front of hundreds of witnesses.[21] The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.[1] Further responses When the British Channel 4 television program The Bermuda Triangle (1992)[22] was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the Equinox series, the marine insurance market Lloyd's of London was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.[3] Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. United States Coast Guard records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.[1] The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker V. A. Fogg, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,[23] in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.[16] In addition, V. A. Fogg sank off the coast of Texas, nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle. Nova/Horizon aired the episode \"The Case of the Bermuda Triangle\" on 27 June 1976. The episode was highly critical, stating that \"When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place ... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world.\"[2] Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves[24] and Barry Singer,[25] have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle. They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.

In a 2013 study, the World Wide Fund for Nature identified the world's 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.[26][27] Benjamin Radford, an author and scientific paranormal investigator, noted in an interview on the Bermuda Triangle that it could be very difficult to locate an aircraft lost at sea due to the vast search area, and although the disappearance might be mysterious, that did not make it paranormal or unexplainable. Radford further noted the importance of double-checking information as the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle had been created by people who had neglected to do so.[28] NOAA attributes most Bermuda Triangle disappearances to environmental factors such as hurricanes, sudden weather shifts from the Gulf Stream, and hazardous shallow waters. The U.S. Navy dismisses supernatural claims, emphasizing natural causes and human error. Additionally, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names does not list the Bermuda Triangle as an official location, given the lack of evidence distinguishing it from other ocean regions.[29] In recent years, scientists and researchers have reiterated that the Bermuda Triangle does not exhibit higher rates of disappearances than other heavily traveled ocean regions. Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki told The Independent in 2017 that the so-called \u201cmystery\u201d can be explained by human error, unpredictable weather, and the sheer volume of traffic passing through the area. According to Kruszelnicki, \u201cOn a percentage basis, the number of accidents in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere else in the world.[30] Hypothetical explanation attempts Those accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have suggested a number of explanations. Paranormal explanations Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost city or state of Atlantis. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the Bimini Road off the island of Bimini in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic Edgar Cayce take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968 as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, but the Bimini Road is of natural origin.[31] Some hypothesize that a parallel universe exists in the Bermuda Triangle region, causing a time/space warp that sucks the objects around it into a parallel universe.[32] Others attribute the events to UFOs.[33][34] Charles Berlitz, author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.[17] Natural explanations Compass variations Compass issues are frequently cited in accounts of Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,[35] such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural magnetic variations in relation to the magnetic poles, a fact that navigators have known for centuries.

Magnetic (compass) north and geographic (true) north are exactly the same only for a small number of places \u2013 for example, as of 2000, in the United States, only those places on a line running from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico.[36] But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass \"changing\" across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.[1] Gulf Stream False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean (NASA) The Gulf Stream (Florida Current) is a major surface current, primarily driven by thermohaline circulation that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the Straits of Florida into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects.[37] It has a maximum surface velocity of about 2 m/s (6.6 ft/s).[38] A small plane making a water landing or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.[39] Human error One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human error.[40] Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, Revonoc, as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on 1 January 1958.[41] Violent weather Tracks of all known Atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2019. Many storms pass through the Bermuda Triangle. Hurricanes are powerful storms which form in tropical waters and have cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of Francisco de Bobadilla's Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane.[42] These storms have caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle. Many Atlantic hurricanes pass through the Triangle as they recurve off the Eastern Seaboard, and, before the advent of weather satellites, ships often had little to no warning of a hurricane's approach.[43] A powerful downdraft of cold air was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of Pride of Baltimore on 14 May 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from 32 km/h (20 mph) to 97\u2013145 km/h (60\u201390 mph). A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated \"during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water.\"[44] Methane hydrates Further information: Methane clathrate Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996.

It has been hypothesized that periodic methane eruptions (sometimes called \"mud volcanoes\") may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate buoyancy for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.[49] Publications by the USGS describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide, including the Blake Ridge area, off the coast of the southeastern United States.[50] However, according to the USGS, no large releases of gas hydrates are believed to have occurred in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 15,000 years.[3] Notable incidents Main article: List of Bermuda Triangle incidents HMS Atalanta Main article: HMS Juno (1844) HMS Atalanta. The Graphic, 1880 The sail training ship HMS Atalanta (originally named HMS Juno) disappeared with her entire crew after setting sail from the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda for Falmouth, England on 31 January 1880.[51] It was presumed that she sank in a powerful storm which crossed her route a couple of weeks after she sailed, and that her crew being composed primarily of inexperienced trainees may have been a contributing factor. The search for evidence of her fate attracted worldwide attention at the time (connection is also often made to the 1878 loss of the training ship HMS Eurydice, which foundered after departing the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda for Portsmouth on 6 March), and she was alleged decades later to have been a victim of the mysterious triangle, an allegation resoundingly refuted by the research of author David Francis Raine in 1997.[52][53][54][55][56] USS Cyclops Main article: USS Cyclops (AC-4) The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier Cyclops, carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 306 sometime after 4 March 1918, after departing the island of Barbados. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that wartime enemy activity was to blame for the loss.[57][58] In addition, two of Cyclops's sister ships, Proteus and Nereus, were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during World War II. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on Cyclops during her fatal voyage.[59] In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

Deering The schooner Carroll A. Deering, as seen from the Cape Lookout lightvessel on 29 January 1921, two days before she was found deserted in North Carolina (US Coast Guard) Carroll A. Deering, a five-masted schooner built in 1919, was found hard aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals, near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 31 January 1921. FBI investigation into the Deering scrutinized, then ruled out, multiple theories as to why and how the ship was abandoned, including piracy, domestic Communist sabotage and the involvement of rum-runners.[60] Flight 19 Main article: Flight 19 US Navy Avengers, similar to those of Flight 19 Flight 19 was a training flight of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared on 5 December 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale for 141 mi (227 km), north for 73 mi (117 km), and then back over a final 140 mi (225 km) leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance was attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel. One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion[61] and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident.[62] According to contemporaneous sources, the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapor leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.[63] Star Tiger and Star Ariel Main articles: BSAA Star Tiger disappearance and BSAA Star Ariel disappearance G-AHNP Star Tiger disappeared on 30 January 1948, on a flight from the Azores to Bermuda; G-AGRE Star Ariel disappeared on 17 January 1949, on a flight from Bermuda to Kingston, Jamaica. Both were Avro Tudor IV passenger aircraft operated by British South American Airways.[64] Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them from reaching the small island.[1] Douglas DC-3 Main article: 1948 Airborne Transport DC-3 disappearance On 28 December 1948, a Douglas DC-3 aircraft, number NC16002, disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft, or the 32 people on board, was ever found. A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the disappearance.[65] Connemara IV A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on 26 September 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer)[17][18] that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes.

The 1955 Atlantic hurricane season shows Hurricane Ione passing nearby between 14 and 18 September, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.[1] In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:[66] On the morning of September 22, Connemara IV was lying to a heavy mooring in the open roadstead of Carlisle Bay. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage. ... In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of Hurricane Janet was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of Connemara IV observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea. KC-135 Stratotankers On 28 August 1963, a pair of US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic 300 miles (480 km) west of Bermuda.[67][68] Some writers[13][17][18] say that while the two aircraft did collide, there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over 160 miles (260 km) of water. However, Kusche's research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report revealed that the debris field defining the second \"crash site\" was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of seaweed and driftwood tangled in an old buoy.[1] See also Oceans portal Weather portal Devil's Sea (or Dragon's Triangle) Golosov Ravine \u2013 Deep ravine in Moscow, Russia List of Bermuda Triangle incidents List of topics characterized as pseudoscience Nevada Triangle Sargasso Sea \u2013 Region of the North Atlantic Ocean SS Cotopaxi \u2013 American bulk carrier sunk in 1925 Vile vortex Notes ^ Sandra disappeared in April 1950; a wreck consistent with its size and cargo was discovered in 2020.[9] ^ Sand's article refers to jockey Albert Snider as Al Snyder, and includes this disappearance although it occurred southwest of Miami in Florida Bay.[10] ^ Sand's article refers to Star Ariel as Aerial.

Since the early 20th century, the field of cosmology establishes that space and time emerged together at the Big Bang 13.787\u00b10.020 billion years ago[10] and that the universe has been expanding since then. The portion of the universe that can be seen by humans is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at present, but the total size of the universe is not known.[3] Some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. During the European Scientific Revolution, astronomical observations led to a heliocentric model. Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters, which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[11] Discoveries in the early 20th century lead to the Big Bang theory with a hot fireball, cooling and becoming less dense as the universe expanded, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today. From studying the effects of gravity on both matter and light, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulae and interstellar gas.

    "chunk": "seen today. From studying the effects of gravity on both matter and light, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulae and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter.[12] In the widely accepted \u039bCDM cosmological model, dark matter accounts for about 25.8%\u00b11.1% of the mass and energy in the universe while about 69.2%\u00b11.2% is dark energy, a mysterious form of energy responsible for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.[13] Ordinary ('baryonic') matter therefore composes only 4.84%\u00b10.1% of the universe.[13] Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of this ordinary matter.[14] There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the universe might be one among many.[3][15][16] Part of a series on Physical cosmology Big Bang \u00b7 Universe Age of the universe Chronology of the universe show Early universe show Expansion \u00b7 Future show Components \u00b7 Structure show Experiments show Scientists show Subject history Category Astronomy portal vte Definition Duration: 50 seconds. 0:50 Hubble Space Telescope \u2013 Ultra-Deep Field galaxies to Legacy field zoom out (video 00:50; May 2, 2019) The physical universe is defined as all of space and time[a] (collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents.[9] Such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including electromagnetic radiation and matter, and therefore planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.[17][18][19] The universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter, such as conservation laws, classical mechanics, and relativity.[20] The universe is often defined as \"the totality of existence\", or everything that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist.[20] In fact, some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas and abstract concepts\u2014such as mathematics and logic\u2014in the definition of the universe.[22][23][24] The word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and nature.[25][26] Etymology The word universe derives from the Old French word univers, which in turn derives from the Latin word universus, meaning 'combined into one'.[27] The Latin word 'universum' was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is used.[28] Synonyms A term for universe among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards was \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd (t\u00f2 p\u00e2n) 'the all', defined as all matter and all space, and \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (t\u00f2 h\u00f3lon) 'all things', which did not necessarily include the void.[29][30] Another synonym was \u1f41 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (ho k\u00f3smos) meaning 'the world, the cosmos'.[31] Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (totum, mundus, natura)[32] and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words Das All, Weltall, and Natur for universe. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything (as in the theory of everything), the cosmos (as in cosmology), the world (as in the many-worlds",

The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the universe. In this schematic diagram, time passes from left to right, with the universe represented by a disk-shaped \"slice\" at any given time. Time and size are not to scale. To make the early stages visible, the time to the afterglow stage (really the first 0.003%) is stretched and the subsequent expansion (really by 1,100 times to the present) is largely suppressed. The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10\u221243 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and gravity\u2014currently the weakest by far of the four known forces\u2014is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. The physics controlling this very early period (including quantum gravity in the Planck epoch) is not understood, so we cannot say what, if anything, happened before time zero. Since the Planck epoch, the universe has been expanding to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of cosmic inflation speculated to have occurred within the first 10\u221232 seconds.[36] This initial period of inflation would explain why space appears to be very flat.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool from its inconceivably hot state, various types of elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable protons and neutrons, which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through nuclear fusion.[37][38] This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe, by mass, were converted to helium, with small amounts of deuterium (a form of hydrogen) and traces of lithium. Any other element was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as hydrogen nuclei.[37][38]: 27\u201342 After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the photon epoch. During this period, the universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral atoms, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable atoms. This is known as recombination for historical reasons; electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are transparent to many wavelengths of light, so for the first time, the universe also became transparent. The photons released (\"decoupled\") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the cosmic microwave background (CMB).[38]: 15\u201327 As the universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of each photon decreases as it is cosmologically redshifted. At around 47,000 years, the energy density of matter became larger than that of photons and neutrinos, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the radiation-dominated era and the start of the matter-dominated era.[39]: 390 In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to concentrations of dark matter gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by gravity, formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and voids where it was least dense. After around 100\u2013300 million years,[39]: 333 the first stars formed, known as Population III stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, non metallic and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual reionization of the universe between about 200\u2013500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through stellar nucleosynthesis.[40] The universe also contains a mysterious energy\u2014possibly a scalar field\u2014called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time.

After about 9.8 billion years, the universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era.[41] In this era, the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy. Physical properties Main articles: Observable universe, Age of the universe, and Expansion of the universe Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.[42]: 1470 The universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter, an asymmetry possibly related to the CP violation.[43] This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the Big Bang, would have completely annihilated each other and left only photons as a result of their interaction.[44] Size and regions See also: Observational cosmology Illustration of the observable universe, centered on the Sun. The distance scale is logarithmic. Due to the finite speed of light, we see more distant parts of the universe at earlier times. Due to the finite speed of light, there is a limit (known as the particle horizon) to how far light can travel over the age of the universe. The spatial region from which we can receive light is called the observable universe. The proper distance (measured at a fixed time) between Earth and the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion light-years[45][46] (14 billion parsecs), making the diameter of the observable universe about 93 billion light-years (28 billion parsecs).[45] Although the distance traveled by light from the edge of the observable universe is close to the age of the universe times the speed of light, 13.8 billion light-years (4.2\u00d7109 pc), the proper distance is larger because the edge of the observable universe and the Earth have since moved further apart.[47] For comparison, the Milky Way is roughly 87,400 light-years in diameter,[48] and the nearest sister galaxy to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, is located roughly 2.5 million light-years away.[49] Because humans cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable universe, it is unknown whether the size of the universe in its totality is finite or infinite.[3][50][51] An estimate from 2011 suggests that if the cosmological principle holds, the whole universe must be more than 250 times larger than a Hubble sphere.[52] Some disputed[53] estimates for the total size of the universe, if finite, reach as high as 10 10 10 122 megaparsecs, as implied by a suggested resolution of the No-Boundary Proposal.[54][b] Age and expansion Main articles: Age of the universe and Expansion of the universe Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the",

For example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed[55] and the universe has expanded. This expansion is inferred from the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted, which implies that the galaxies are receding from us. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion is accelerating.[56][57] The more matter there is in the universe, the stronger the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the universe contained too little matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass\u2013energy density, equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.[58][59] There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the deceleration parameter, which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately \u22120.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic scale factor \ud835\udc4e \u00a8 has been positive in the last 5\u20136 billion years.[60][61] Spacetime Main articles: Spacetime and World line See also: Lorentz transformation Modern physics regards events as being organized into spacetime.[62] This idea originated with the special theory of relativity, which predicts that if one observer sees two events happening in different places at the same time, a second observer who is moving relative to the first will see those events happening at different times.[63]: 45\u201352 The two observers will disagree on the time \ud835\udc47 between the events, and they will disagree about the distance \ud835\udc37 separating the events, but they will agree on the speed of light \ud835\udc50 , and they will measure the same value for the combination \ud835\udc50 2 \ud835\udc47 2 \u2212 \ud835\udc37 2 .[63]: 80 The square root of the absolute value of this quantity is called the interval between the two events.

The interval expresses how widely separated events are, not just in space or in time, but in the combined setting of spacetime.[63]: 84, 136 [64] The special theory of relativity describes a flat spacetime. Its successor, the general theory of relativity, explains gravity as curvature of spacetime arising due to its energy content. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve\",[65][66] and therefore there is no point in considering one without the other.[67] The Newtonian theory of gravity is a good approximation to the predictions of general relativity when gravitational effects are weak and objects are moving slowly compared to the speed of light.[68]: 327 [69] The relation between matter distribution and spacetime curvature is given by the Einstein field equations, which require tensor calculus to express.[70]: 43 [71] The universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three spatial dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension. Therefore, an event in the spacetime of the physical universe can be identified by a set of four coordinates: (x, y, z, t). Shape Main article: Shape of the universe The three possible options for the shape of the universe Cosmologists often work with space-like slices of spacetime that are surfaces of constant time in comoving coordinates. The geometry of these spatial slices is set by the density parameter, Omega (\u03a9), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether \u03a9 is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.[72] Observations, including the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck maps of the CMB, suggest that the universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) models.[73][74][75][76] These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy.[77][78] Support of life Main article: Fine-tuned universe The fine-tuned universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable life in the universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range of values. According to this hypothesis, if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. Whether this is true, and whether that question is even logically meaningful to ask, are subjects of much debate.[79] The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.[80] Composition See",

Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated to constitute from 0.005% to close to 0.01% of the total mass\u2013energy of the universe) and antimatter.[81][82][83] The proportions of all types of matter and energy have changed over the history of the universe.[84] The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years.[85][86] Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the universe.[7] The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221231 grams per cubic centimeter, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume.[5] The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the cosmic contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.[7][87][88] The formation of clusters and large-scale filaments in the cold dark matter model with dark energy. The frames show the evolution of structures in a 43 million parsecs (or 140 million light-years) box from redshift of 30 to the present epoch (upper left z=30 to lower right z=0). A map of the superclusters and voids nearest to Earth Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously throughout the universe over length scales longer than 300 million light-years (ly) or so.[89] However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable universe contains as many as an estimated 2 trillion galaxies[90][91][92] and, overall, as many as an estimated 1024 stars[93][94] \u2013 more stars (and earth-like planets) than all the grains of beach sand on planet Earth;[95][96][97] but less than the total number of atoms estimated in the universe as 1082;[98] and the estimated total number of stars in an inflationary universe (observed and unobserved), as 10100.[99] Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million[100] (107) stars up to giants with one trillion[101] (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are voids, which are typically 10\u2013150 Mpc (33 million\u2013490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster.[102] This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years.[103] The universe also has vast regions of relative emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc) across.[104] Comparison of the contents",

The observable universe is isotropic on scales significantly larger than superclusters, meaning that the statistical properties of the universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvins.[6] The hypothesis that the large-scale universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as the cosmological principle.[106] A universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.[107][108] Dark energy Main article: Dark energy An explanation for why the expansion of the universe is accelerating remains elusive. It is often attributed to the gravitational influence of \"dark energy\", an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space.[109] On a mass\u2013energy equivalence basis, the density of dark energy (~ 7 \u00d7 10\u221230 g/cm3) is much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, in the present dark-energy era, it dominates the mass\u2013energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.[110][111] Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously,[112] and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space while still permeating them enough to cause the observed rate of expansion. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Dark matter Main article: Dark matter Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that is invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum, but which accounts for most of the matter in the universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. Other than neutrinos, a form of hot dark matter, dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. Dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light or any other electromagnetic radiation at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass\u2013energy and 84.5% of the total matter in the universe.[87][113] Ordinary matter Main article: Matter Masses and sizes of objects in the Universe[114] The remaining 4.9% of the mass\u2013energy of the universe is ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, electrons and the objects they form.

An atom consists of an atomic nucleus, made up of protons and neutrons (both of which are baryons), and electrons that orbit the nucleus.[42]: 1476 Soon after the Big Bang, primordial protons and neutrons formed from the quark\u2013gluon plasma of the early universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.[123] Particles Standard model of elementary particles: the 12 fundamental fermions and 4 fundamental bosons.

A true force\u2013particle \"theory of everything\" has not been attained.[132] Hadrons Main article: Hadron A hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern universe.[133]: 118\u2013123 From approximately 10\u22126 seconds after the Big Bang, during a period known as the hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially, the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron\u2013anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, hadron\u2013anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle\u2013antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the universe was about one second old.[133]: 244\u2013266 Leptons Main article: Lepton A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.[134] Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particles that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.[135][136] Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium.

The electron governs nearly all of chemistry, as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties. Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the universe but rarely interact with normal matter.[137] The lepton epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch, the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton\u2013anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton\u2013anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.[138] Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.[139][140] Photons Main article: Photon epoch See also: Photino A photon is the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is the carrier for the electromagnetic force. The effects of this force are easily observable at the microscopic and at the macroscopic level because the photon has zero rest mass; this allows long distance interactions.[42]: 1470 The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the universe contained a hot dense plasma of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in the temperature of the CMB correspond to variations in the density of the universe that were the early \"seeds\" from which all subsequent structure formation took place.[133]: 244\u2013266 show vte Timeline of the Big Bang Habitability The frequency of life in the universe has been a frequent point of investigation in astronomy and astrobiology, being the issue of the Drake equation and the different views on it, from identifying the Fermi paradox, the situation of not having found any signs of extraterrestrial life, to arguments for a biophysical cosmology, a view of life being inherent to the physical cosmology of the universe.[141] Cosmological models Model of the universe based on general relativity Main article: Solutions of the Einstein field equations See also:",

It is the basis of current cosmological models of the universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present.[142] The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the universe over time.[142] With the assumption of the cosmological principle that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the universe is the metric tensor called the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric, \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc60 2 = \u2212 \ud835\udc50 2 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc61 2 + \ud835\udc45 ( \ud835\udc61 ) 2 ( \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc5f 2 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5f 2 + \ud835\udc5f 2 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf03 2 + \ud835\udc5f 2 sin 2 \u2061 \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udf19 2 ) where (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) correspond to a spherical coordinate system. This metric has only two undetermined parameters. An overall dimensionless length scale factor R describes the size scale of the universe as a function of time (an increase in R is the expansion of the universe),[143] and a curvature index k describes the geometry. The index k is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry; 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature; or \u22121, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.[144] The value of R as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant \u039b.[142] The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.[88] The equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.[145] The solutions for R(t) depend on k and \u039b, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the universe can remain constant only if the universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k = 1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein.[142] Second, all solutions suggest that there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter",

It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.[146] Third, the curvature index k determines the sign of the curvature of constant-time spatial surfaces[144] averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light-years). If k = 1, the curvature is positive and the universe has a finite volume.[147] A universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the universe has an infinite volume.[147] It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could be created in a single instant when R = 0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k is nonpositive and the cosmological principle is satisfied. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. The ultimate fate of the universe is still unknown because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant \u039b. If the universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch,[148] possibly starting a new universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or \u22121 and the universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the universe.[142] Modern data suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating; if this acceleration is sufficiently rapid, the universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.[149] Multiverse hypotheses Main articles: Multiverse, Many-worlds interpretation, and Bubble universe theory See also: Eternal inflation Some speculative theories have proposed that our universe is but one of a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the universe.[15][150] Max Tegmark developed a four-part classification scheme for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various problems in physics.

An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the chaotic inflation model of the early universe.[151] Another is the multiverse resulting from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave functions being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.[152] Whether scientifically meaningful probabilities can be extracted from this picture has been and continues to be a topic of much debate, and multiple versions of the many-worlds interpretation exist.[153][154][155] The subject of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is in general marked by disagreement.[156][157][158] The least controversial, but still highly disputed, category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is Level I. The multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events \"in our own universe\". Tegmark and others[159] have argued that, if space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called doppelg\u00e4nger is 1010115 metres away from us (a double exponential function larger than a googolplex).[160][161] However, the arguments used are of speculative nature.[162] It is possible to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another.[160][163] An easily visualized metaphor of this concept is a group of separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle.[164] According to one common terminology, each \"soap bubble\" of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas humans' particular spacetime is denoted as the universe,[15] just as humans call Earth's moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse.[15] With this terminology, different universes are not causally connected to each other.[15] In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative.[15] Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.[15] Historical conceptions See also: Cosmology, Timeline of cosmological theories, Nicolaus Copernicus \u00a7 Copernican system, and Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica \u00a7 Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies).

The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.[167] Mythologies Main articles: Creation myth, Cosmogony, and Religious cosmology Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and universe. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the universe as it is now to a god just setting the \"wheels in motion\" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).[168] Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories.[169][170] For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the universe. In another type of story, the universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the M\u0101ori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god\u2014as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology\u2014or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, and the creation myth of the Serers.[171] Philosophical models Further information: Cosmology See also: Pre-Socratic philosophy, Physics (Aristotle), Hindu cosmology, Islamic cosmology, and Philosophy of space and time The pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the universe.[165][172] The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the",

    "chunk": "all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers\u2014most notably Leucippus\u2014proposed that the universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through a void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.[165] Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change,[173] his contemporary Parmenides emphasized changelessness. Parmenides' poem On Nature has been read as saying that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature, or at least that the essential feature of each thing that exists must exist eternally, without origin, change, or end.[174] His student Zeno of Elea challenged everyday ideas about motion with several famous paradoxes. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum.[175][176] The Indian philosopher Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika school, developed a notion of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance.[177] In the 5th century AD, the Buddhist atomist philosopher Dign\u0101ga proposed atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.[178] The notion of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).[179] Pantheism is the philosophical religious belief that the universe itself is identical to divinity and a supreme being or entity.[180] The physical universe is thus understood as an all-encompassing, immanent deity.[181] The term 'pantheist' designates one who holds both that everything constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine, consisting of an all-encompassing, manifested god or goddess.[182][183] Astronomical concepts Main articles: History of astronomy and Timeline of astronomy 3rd century BCE calculations by Aristarchus on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy The earliest written records of identifiable predecessors to",

Some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[188][165] The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos, a student of Plato who followed Plato's idea that heavenly motions had to be circular. In order to account for the known complications of the planets' motions, particularly retrograde movement, Eudoxus' model included 27 different celestial spheres: four for each of the planets visible to the naked eye, three each for the Sun and the Moon, and one for the stars. All of these spheres were centered on the Earth, which remained motionless while they rotated eternally. Aristotle elaborated upon this model, increasing the number of spheres to 55 in order to account for further details of planetary motion. For Aristotle, normal matter was entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere, and it obeyed fundamentally different rules from heavenly material.[189][190] The post-Aristotle treatise De Mundo (of uncertain authorship and date) stated, \"Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater\u2014namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether\u2014make up the whole universe\".[191] This model was also refined by Callippus and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy.[192] The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the Fourier modes). Other Greek scientists, such as the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated (according to Stobaeus' account) that at the center of the universe was a \"central fire\" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion.[193] The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known individual to propose a heliocentric model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote: You, King Gelon, are aware the universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of",

But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.[194] Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be the explanation for the unobservability of stellar parallax.[195] Flammarion engraving, Paris 1888 The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.[196][197][198] According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides.[199] According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.[200] Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, similar to Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century.[201] During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also proposed by the Persian astronomers Albumasar[202] and Al-Sijzi.[203] Model of the Copernican Universe by Thomas Digges in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the planets The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the Earth rotated on its axis and if the Sun were placed at the center of the universe.[204] In the center rests the Sun.

Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440).[205] Al-Sijzi[206] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201\u20131274) and Ali Qushji (1403\u20131474).[207] This cosmology was accepted by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists.[208] Newton demonstrated that the same laws of motion and gravity apply to earthly and to celestial matter, making Aristotle's division between the two obsolete. Edmund Halley (1720)[209] and Jean-Philippe de Ch\u00e9seaux (1744)[210] noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century.[211] Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity.[208] This instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion.[212] One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert.[213][214] Deep space astronomy During the 18th century, Immanuel Kant speculated that nebulae could be entire galaxies separate from the Milky Way,[209] and in 1850, Alexander von Humboldt called these separate galaxies Weltinseln, or \"world islands\", a term that later developed into \"island universes\".[215][216] In 1919, when the Hooker Telescope was completed, the prevailing view was that the universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922\u20131923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that the universe consists of a multitude of galaxies.[217] With this Hubble formulated the Hubble constant, which allowed for the first time a calculation of the age of the universe and size of the Observable Universe, which became increasingly precise with better meassurements, starting at 2 billion years and 280 million light-years, until 2006 when data of the Hubble Space Telescope allowed a very accurate calculation of the age of the universe and size of the Observable Universe.[218] The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of",

They are called \"qualities\" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in S\u0101nkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna, \"quality\", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas ('qualities').\" ^ Viney, Donald Wayne (1985). \"The Cosmological Argument\".
